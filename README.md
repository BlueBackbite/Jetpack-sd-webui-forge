# Jetpack-sd-webui-forge
A docker file for building Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge on Jetson/Jetpack enabled nvidia devices.

Heavily commented and a mess, but as of 1/2/2025 this works.
Left the comments in for anyone who wishes to see how to build the dependencies manually.

XFormers 0.0.27 will not build with CUDA 12.6/Torch 2.4.
